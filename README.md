# Storage assessment

A test page that tries to store things in various back ends (cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB) to help you assess if your Developer Tools let you inspect and edit the data comfortably.

## Usage

Access `index.html` using a secure protocol, or visiting [this site](http://firefox-dev.tools/storage-assessment/). It'll remove previous test data (if present) and install new test data. Open your developer tools and look at the storage tool and see what works and what doesn't.

The `index.html` page also contains an analysis of each area and the current results. These are manual and are not automatically updated.

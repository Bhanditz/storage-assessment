				<p>Display at-a-glance storage information: number of entries, size/length, etc.</p>
				<p><em>Not implemented</em></p>

			<dt data-status="no">CRUD</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Records can be created, retrieved, updated and deleted.</p>
				<p><ul>
						<li>Firefox: <ul>
								<li>Records can barely be retrieved. Out of 100 initial records, only up to 50 are rendered in the localStorage, IndexedDB views.</li>
								<li>Records can be sorted by key or value</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Chrome: <ul>
								<li>IndexedDB also only shows 50, but lets you move between 'pages' of 50 records.</li>
								<li>localStorage shows all the 100 records.</li>
								<li>When refreshing the store data, you really need to close devtools and open again to see the new data, otherwise it keeps showing the old contents (?).</li>
								<li>It's not possible to sort by key or value.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

			<dt data-status="no">Perceived as fast</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>The panel speed is perceived as fast. Visual feedback (spinners etc) is displayed while loading data.</p>
				<p>Loading data is asynchronous or progressive. Rows are rendered as soon as they can be retrieved, or at least in batches.</p>
				<p><em>"No data present for selected host" is erroneusly displayed while loading (albeit data is present). Everything is rendered at once.</em></p>

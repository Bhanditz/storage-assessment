				<p>Records can be created, retrieved, updated and deleted.</p>
				<p><ul>
						<li>Firefox: <ul>
								<li>Create: can create cookies pressing the "+" button or context menu "Add Item" option.</li>
								<li>Retrieve: <ul>
										<li data-status="no">Records can inconsistently be retrieved. Out of 100 initial records, only up to 50 are rendered in the localStorage, IndexedDB views. The whole 100 are rendered in the cookie view.</li>
										<li>Records can be sorted by key, value (or other fields e.g. domain, in Cookie view).</li>
								</ul></li>
								<li>Delete: can delete individual cookies, can delete all by host or session (w/context menu).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Chrome: <ul>
								<li data-status="no">Create: Not implemented (or I can't find how)</li>
								<li>Retrieve: <ul>
									<li>IndexedDB also only shows 50, but lets you move between 'pages' of 50 records.</li>
									<li>localStorage, Cookie show all the 100 records.</li>
									<li data-status="no">When refreshing the store data, you really need to close devtools and open again to see the new data, otherwise it keeps showing the old contents (?).</li>
									<li data-status="no">It's not possible to sort by key or value.</li>
								</ul></li>
								<li>Delete: for all of cookie, localStorage, and IndexedDB views, it's possible to delete individual entries, selected or 'all' (with the forbidden sign button)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>Perceived as fast</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>The panel speed is perceived as fast. Visual feedback (spinners etc) is displayed while loading data.</p>
				<p>Loading data is asynchronous or progressive. Rows are rendered as soon as they can be retrieved, or at least in batches.</p>
				<p><ul>
						<li>Firefox: <ul>
								<li data-status="no">"No data present for selected host" is erroneusly displayed while loading (despite data being present).</li>
								<li data-status="no">Jank, as everything is rendered at once.</li>
								<li data-status="no">Cookies view does a weird flashy fade from yellow thing as it sort of updates rows, I guess to highlight the fact they were rendered (?). It is very distracting and looks super slow and janky.</li>
						</ul></li>
						<li>Chrome: almost instant render--get to see a blank state for a fraction of a second, but no confusing weirdnesses</li>
				</ul></p>
